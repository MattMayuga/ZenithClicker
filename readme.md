# Zenith Clicker

    Welcome to Zenith Clicker! Select required tarots to send players to scale the tower.  
    The higher the tower, the more tricky players will come!  
    There's no leaderboard, but how high can you reach?

> All Arts & Sounds from [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io) by osk, an online stacker game with Awesome Graphics and Musics!

Inspired by mod selection screen of tetr.io QP2, its interactive feel is really not good for quickly picking the mods needed,  
and there's still no convenient way to know which mods are included in a specific combo.
